# mockito-training
This project contains some code and a unit test class with Mockito exercises

Your task is to write some test code to test ProductDataProcessor, tasks are described in //TODO comments.

You will need to use Mockito to mock ProductRepository - it has not been implemented yet, but we know the interface :)
